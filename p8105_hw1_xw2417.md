This is the solution for P8105 homework 1 from Xun Wang.

## Problem 1

The code chunk below creates a dataframe compromised of a random sample
of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a
character vector of length 8, a factor vector of length 8 with 3
different factor “levels”.

``` r
hw_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c("This","is", "the", "first", "data", "frame", "from", "Xun")，
  vec_factor = factor(c("he", "he", "he", "she", "she", "she", "they", "they"))
)
```
